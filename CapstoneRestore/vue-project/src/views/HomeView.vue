<p>We all know that walking is a great way to sustain healthy living: It improves our mood by decreasing anxiety and depression, aids in concentration, increases energy and stamina, supports our overall physical health and gives us a better night's sleep. </p>
<p>Art helps us to cope with pain and distress, along with reducing the risk of developing mental illness.</p>
<h3>Why not have both?</h3>
<p>"Walking among art is a journey of the soul; each step nourishes the mind, emboldens the heart and strengthens the body."</p>
